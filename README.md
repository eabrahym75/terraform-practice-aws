## Terraform AWS CI/CD AUTOMATION WITH Github ACtions.

This is a Terraform task where i need to setup two EC2 instances and install apache and Nginx web servers on each, then provision a Load Balancer and security group to regulate inbound traffic and also allow me to ssh into the instances, then take it step further by provisioning an autoscaling group.
finally, I'll set up a CI/CD automation to lint, and carry out the Terraform trinity; 

> terraform init

> terraform apply 

> terraform destroy 

using with Github actions.
